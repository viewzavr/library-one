# library-one

An idea is that everyone may pull-request here links to any Viewzavr modules
and thus make them available to everyone who import this library.

# Adding to Viewzavr project

```
import setup_library_one from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/viewzavr/library-one@master/init.js";

setup_library_one(vz).then( .... );
```

# Future plans

* Make a "checkbox" installation of modules/libraries.
Thus only things that are selected by a user will be loaded.

* Improve Viewzavr for async appearance of types. Thus we may load scene and create objects as their types appear
in Viewzavr type table as their modules loaded.
